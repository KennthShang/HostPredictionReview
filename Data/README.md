# Computational approaches for virus-host prediction: A review of methods and applications

There are four datasets in this folder:

* CRISPRs: 2,005,489 CIRPSRs derived from the prokaryotic genomes using CRT v1.2 
* tRNA: 7,709,234 tRNA genes derived from the prokaryotic genomes using ARAGORN
* RefSeq-VHDB: datasets used in the first benckmark
* MetaHic-VHDB: datasets used in the second benchmark

The datasets can be downloaded via: https://github.com/KennthShang/HostPredictionReview/releases
